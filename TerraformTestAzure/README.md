# Terraform Test Azure

ADD A NEW STORY ISSUE #1430   infra changes 

Test deployment of Azure infrastructiure using Terraform and ADO

ADD A NEW FEATURE User Story:

As a DevOps engineer,
I want to create an Azure DevOps pipeline for Terraform,
So that I can automate the infrastructure provisioning and management processes.

Acceptance Criteria:

The pipeline should trigger on changes to the main branch.
It should run on Azure Pipelines using the Windows latest agent.
The pipeline should use the latest version of Terraform.
The pipeline should have three stages: INIT, PLAN, and APPLY.
The INIT stage should set up the Terraform backend configuration.
The PLAN stage should perform a Terraform plan operation.
The APPLY stage should apply the Terraform changes to the infrastructure.
The pipeline should be configured to use an Azure service connection for authentication.
The service connection should have access to the specified backend Azure resources.
Tasks:

Set up a new Azure DevOps pipeline.
Configure the pipeline to trigger on changes to the main branch.
Specify the Azure Pipelines agent to use the Windows latest VM image.
Add a task to install the latest version of Terraform.
Add an INIT stage to configure the Terraform backend with the specified settings.
Add a PLAN stage to execute the Terraform plan operation.
Add an APPLY stage to apply the Terraform changes to the infrastructure.
Configure the pipeline to use the provided Azure service connection for authentication.
Test the pipeline by making changes to the Terraform configuration and verifying successful execution.
Additional Considerations:

Handle potential errors and failures during the pipeline execution and provide appropriate notifications and error handling mechanisms.
Add additional stages or tasks as needed, such as testing or environment provisioning, depending on the specific project requirements.
Document the pipeline configuration and provide clear instructions for pipeline setup and customization.

This user story outlines the objective, acceptance criteria, and tasks involved in creating an Azure DevOps pipeline for Terraform. It ensures that the pipeline triggers on the correct events, uses the appropriate agent, and executes the necessary stages for Terraform initialization, planning, and applying changes. It also emphasizes the need for proper authentication and error handling within the pipeline.
